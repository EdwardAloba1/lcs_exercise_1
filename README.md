# Edward Aloba Documentation

My goal for this project was to be able to demonstrate my skills with front end and back end work. My goal was to be able to abstract all the code so it's easy for anyone to read. I created a class for Members Table, and Commitee table.

If I had more time, I would have added the commitees that the different members were apart of to the members table, and the members that are apart of the different commitees.
