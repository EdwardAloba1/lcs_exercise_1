# Edward Aloba Documentation

My goal for this project was to be able to demonstrate my skills with front end and back end work. My goal was to be able to abstract all the code so it's easy for anyone to read. I created a class for Members Table, and Commitee table.

Currently, the bulk of the code is located within App.tsx in the src folder, and Commitee.tsx and Members.tsx within the components folder. 

I would also like to use this opportunity to thank everyone at The office of the clerk team as well for this interview process. This project was a very fun project and I'm glad and excited I'm at this point in the interview. Definetly looking forward to what the future holds.

Now, to my code!

Note: 

This project is a typescript project so all the actions/instruction to run it that were previously given should run this project.

Just make sure to run `yarn start` in the [frontend](frontend) folder

##[App.tsx](frontend)
This file handles all of the headers and Nav bar information for the page. It also grabs all of the essential json information to pass into the html render at the bottom of the page. 

The top of the page includes a navigation bar with 
Some things [App.css](frontend/src/App.css) to not about this package, I created some get methods that made grabbing the json data easier, and created a title underneath the Navbar that gives a brief introduction to The Office of the Clerk.

If I had more time, I would have added the commitees that the different members were apart of to the members table, and the members that are apart of the different commitees.
